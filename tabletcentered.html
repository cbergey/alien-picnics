    <!-- Include library [mmturkey][mmturkey], which manages submitting data to Mechanical Turk. This defines a global object, <code>turk</code>, and attaches five properties to it, <code>hitId</code>, <code>assignmentId</code>, <code>workerId</code>, <code>previewMode</code>, and <code>turkSubmitTo</code>. It also provides a single method, <code>submit(data)</code>, which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), <code>submit</code> displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like <code>workerId</code> and <code>assignmentId</code>).  -->

        <p class="block-text">On planet Zorg, aliens like to have gatherings much like human picnics. When they do, they each bring an object to the gathering to share, but they plan together to always have a well-rounded meal.</p> 
        <p class="block-text"> In this task, it is your job to observe what the aliens bring to their gatherings to make good meals. You will see a series of gatherings in which aliens bring different objects, and then you'll be asked questions about them.</p>
